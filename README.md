Overview

The code consists of a set of functions that perform conversions for different measurement categories:

    Length Conversions: Converts values between meters, feet, and inches.
    Weight Conversions: Converts values between kilograms, pounds, and grams.
    Temperature Conversions: Converts values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

The tool guides the user through the conversion process, prompting for the category, value to be converted, source unit, and target unit. It then calculates and displays the result of the conversion.
Usage

To use the conversion tool, follow these steps:

    Run the script in your preferred Python environment.

    Enter the category (length, weight, or temperature) for the conversion.

    Provide the value you want to convert.

    Enter the source unit (e.g., meters, feet, kilograms, celsius) for the conversion.

    Enter the target unit (e.g., inches, pounds, fahrenheit) for the conversion.

    The tool will display the converted result or an error message if invalid inputs are provided.

Functions

The code includes several functions to facilitate the conversion process:

    convert_length(value, from_unit, to_unit): Converts length values between meters, feet, and inches.
    convert_weight(value, from_unit, to_unit): Converts weight values between kilograms, pounds, and grams.
    convert_temperature(value, from_unit, to_unit): Converts temperature values between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
    get_numeric_input(prompt): Prompts the user to enter a numeric value for conversion.
    get_category(): Prompts the user to select the conversion category (length, weight, or temperature).

Examples
Length Conversion Example

mathematica

Enter the category (length, weight, temperature): length
Enter the value to convert: 5
Enter the source unit (e.g., meters, feet, inches): meters
Enter the target unit (e.g., meters, feet, inches): feet
5.0 meters is equal to 16.4042 feet

Weight Conversion Example

mathematica

Enter the category (length, weight, temperature): weight
Enter the value to convert: 100
Enter the source unit (e.g., kilograms, pounds, grams): kilograms
Enter the target unit (e.g., kilograms, pounds, grams): pounds
100.0 kilograms is equal to 220.462 pounds

Temperature Conversion Example

mathematica

Enter the category (length, weight, temperature): temperature
Enter the value to convert: 32
Enter the source unit (celsius, fahrenheit): fahrenheit
Enter the target unit (celsius, fahrenheit): celsius
32.0 fahrenheit is equal to 0.0 celsius

Error Handling

The code includes error handling to ensure a smooth user experience. It will display error messages for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric values or unsupported units. Users are guided to provide correct inputs to perform successful conversions.
